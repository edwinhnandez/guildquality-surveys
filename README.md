##  Database design

IDs: use BIGINT UNSIGNED for all PKs. (1 billion fits in INT UNSIGNED, but BIGINT keeps headroom for growth.)

Naming: keep columns short; add composite PK/unique where it helps.

Pivot table: survey_question with composite PK (survey_id, question_id); add a secondary index on (question_id, survey_id) for reverse lookups.

Engine/charset: InnoDB, utf8mb4.

Partitioning (optional, advanced): If you truly expect ultra-high scale now, you can partition survey_question by HASH(survey_id) in MySQL. Laravel migrations can issue raw SQL for partitioning (see note in migration). Weâ€™ll keep it optional and discuss it during the interview (as the exercise suggests DB optimization will be reviewed).
